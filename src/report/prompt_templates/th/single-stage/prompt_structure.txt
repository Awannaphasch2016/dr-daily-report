IMPORTANT: When high-impact news [1], [2] exists in the data, reference it naturally in your story when relevant. Don't force it - only use if it meaningfully affects the narrative.

Structure (in Thai):

📖 **เรื่องราวของหุ้นตัวนี้**
Write 2-3 sentences telling the STORY. MUST include: uncertainty score context + ATR% + VWAP% + volume ratio with their meanings. Include news naturally if relevant.

💡 **สิ่งที่คุณต้องรู้**
Write 3-4 flowing paragraphs (NOT numbered lists) that explain WHY this matters to an investor. MUST continuously reference:
- The 4 market condition elements (uncertainty, ATR, VWAP, volume) with numbers throughout
- Fundamental metrics (P/E ratio, EPS, Market Cap, Revenue Growth, Profit Margin) - CRITICAL: Mention at least 2-3 fundamental metrics
- Chart patterns from Financial Markets MCP (if available) - CRITICAL: Mention detected patterns and their implications
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA trends)
- Comparative analysis (relative performance vs peers)
- News (when relevant)
Mix all elements seamlessly - don't section them.{STRATEGY_INTEGRATION}

🎯 **ควรทำอะไรตอนนี้?**
Give ONE clear action: BUY MORE / SELL / HOLD. Explain WHY in 2-3 sentences using uncertainty score + market conditions (ATR/VWAP/volume). Reference news if it changes the decision.{STRATEGY_RECOMMENDATION}

⚠️ **ระวังอะไร?**
Warn about 1-2 key risks using the 4 market condition metrics. What volatility/pressure/volume signals should trigger concern? Keep it practical.

Rules for narrative flow:
- Tell STORIES, don't list bullet points - write like you're texting a friend investor
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS include all 4 market condition metrics (uncertainty, ATR%, VWAP%, volume ratio) with specific numbers AND percentile context throughout
- Use numbers IN sentences as evidence, not as standalone facts
- Explain WHY things matter (implication), not just WHAT they are (description)
- Mix technical + fundamental + relative + news + statistical context + comparative analysis + chart patterns seamlessly - don't section them
- CRITICAL: MUST mention fundamental metrics (P/E, EPS, Market Cap, Growth) in "สิ่งที่คุณต้องรู้" section
- CRITICAL: MUST mention chart patterns from Financial Markets MCP (if available) in technical analysis discussion
- Reference news [1], [2] ONLY when it genuinely affects the story
- CRITICAL: When percentile data is available, USE IT to add historical context to numbers (e.g., "RSI 75 ซึ่งอยู่ในเปอร์เซ็นไทล์ 85%")
- Write under 12-15 lines total
- NO tables, NO numbered lists in the insight section, just flowing narrative

Write entirely in Thai, naturally flowing like Damodaran's style - narrative supported by numbers, not numbers with explanation.
